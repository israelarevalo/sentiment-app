2022-02-23 07:06:37,"I’ve never given a review before, but I felt this app warranted one. I’ve only had it maybe two days now, but I think it’s been really helpful. My psychologist recommended it to me. So far I’ve been using the thought diary and I really like that the app really gets you to assess and analyze the thoughts you’re having. There are also some other great features like the videos and safety planning that I’m excited to utilize. I often have trouble being consistent with things, but I’m hoping to be consistent with this. I think it’ll really help long term. If you’re struggling with depression or anxiety and you’re looking for something to challenge your negative thoughts, I definitely recommend giving this a try. For reference, I’m a 20 year old African American female college student. Hope this helps :)",5,False,Great Tool,sunmer1998

2021-03-21 19:17:49,"This app has some helpful tools, but the way the AI works can be frustrating. For example, you can be in the middle of making a safety plan, but if you say the words, ‘panic attack’ when it asks about your triggers the AI switches to the script for dealing with panic attacks and you can’t go back to finishing the safety plan as far as I can tell. The app is a good idea that needs some finesse.",2,False,The AI is frustrating sometimes,Invisible Watcher

2018-01-25 01:11:56,"I am a clinical psychologist, and I use this app all the time with my patients. It includes the basic principles of CBT, one of the best therapies for depression. The information is clear and practical. However, if you are really depressed and struggling, especially if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself, you should know that the research about CBT working always shows that your relationship with your therapist is the most important predictor of getting better in treatment. That is, there isn’t much research out there about how well the tools work as self-help. So try it, and if it doesn’t do enough or if you are a danger to yourself, talk to someone, too, to get the help you need. On the other hand, if you ARE a therapist, this is an excellent tool that you to use with a patient. IMHO, it far exceeds giving your patient a piece of paper for psychoeducation, safety planning, or records of activation or cognitive reframing.  These papers only sometimes makes it through a whole week without getting lost, whereas patients almost always have their phones or tablets nearby.",5,False,"Excellent, science based tool",Dr. Lightsey
2015-11-27 04:02:07,"It's great for anyone suffering from anxiety, depressed and bipolar disorders. It's been very helpful in my recovery from recently diagnosed bipolar disorder and hospitalization. I had used it briefly before when I was only diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorder. But now after my recent battle and new diagnosis I've taken a more serious and proactive approach to my treatment. It implements all the CBT skills taught in treatment very well. I can't recommend this enough to my fellow brethren battling mental illness.",5,False,Excellent,Kraken Attack
2018-03-25 17:07:44,"Compared to most free self-help apps, this one is pretty good. It’s angled toward depression, which means it’s got a great array of resources and guides to help you cope with that specifically. But if the app were to expand its services to other disorders such as anxiety, eating disorders, and so on, I think it would help a great deal more!

Another suggestion I have, is the ability to customize the individual activities they provide for you. I’m aware there is a ‘Custom’ option, but for example, adding a list to the Chores activity, which you are then free to edit and mark off as you complete the tasks one by one, would make things a lot simpler and easier. Having the different options all in one place makes for easy customization (which I believe is very important to the individual).

Overall, hope to see more from this app! But as it is now, it’s a certainly welcome little tool, that I will be sure to use in times of distress and emotional management.",4,False,"Could be better, could be worse",furryftw
